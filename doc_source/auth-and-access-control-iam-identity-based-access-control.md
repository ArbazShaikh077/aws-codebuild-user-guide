# Using Identity\-Based Policies for CodeBuild<a name="auth-and-access-control-iam-identity-based-access-control"></a>

This topic provides examples of identity\-based policies that demonstrate how an account administrator can attach permissions policies to IAM identities \(that is, users, groups, and roles\) and thereby grant permissions to perform operations on AWS CodeBuild resources\.

**Important**  
We recommend that you first review the introductory topics that explain the basic concepts and options available to manage access to your CodeBuild resources\. For more information, see [Overview of Managing Access Permissions to Your CodeBuild Resources](auth-and-access-control-iam-access-control-identity-based.md)\.

**Topics**
+ [Permissions Required to Use the CodeBuild Console](#console-permissions)
+ [Permissions Required for the CodeBuild Console to Connect to Source Providers](#console-policies)
+ [AWS Managed \(Predefined\) Policies for CodeBuild](#managed-policies)
+ [CodeBuild Managed Policies and Notifications](#notifications-permissions)
+ [Customer\-Managed Policy Examples](#customer-managed-policies)

The following shows an example of a permissions policy that allows a user to get information about build projects only in the `us-east-2` region for account `123456789012` for any build project that starts with the name `my`:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "codebuild:BatchGetProjects",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:codebuild:us-east-2:123456789012:project/my*"      
    }
  ]
}
```

## Permissions Required to Use the CodeBuild Console<a name="console-permissions"></a>

A user who uses the AWS CodeBuild console must have a minimum set of permissions that allows the user to describe other AWS resources for the AWS account\. You must have permissions from the following services:
+ AWS CodeBuild
+ Amazon CloudWatch
+ CodeCommit \(if you are storing your source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository\)
+ Amazon Elastic Container Registry \(Amazon ECR\) \(if you are using a build environment that relies on a Docker image in an Amazon ECR repository\)
+ Amazon Elastic Container Service \(Amazon ECS\) \(if you are using a build environment that relies on a Docker image in an Amazon ECR repository\)
+ AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)
+ AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\)
+ Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)

If you create an IAM policy that is more restrictive than the minimum required permissions, the console won't function as intended\.

## Permissions Required for the CodeBuild Console to Connect to Source Providers<a name="console-policies"></a>

The AWS CodeBuild console uses the following API actions to connect to source providers \(for example, GitHub repositories\)\.
+ `codebuild:ListConnectedOAuthAccounts`
+ `codebuild:ListRepositories`
+ `codebuild:PersistOAuthToken`
+ `codebuild:ImportSourceCredentials`

You can associate source providers \(such as GitHub repositories\) with your build projects using the CodeBuild console\. To do this, you must first add the preceding API actions to IAM access policies associated with the IAM user you use to access the CodeBuild console\.

The `ListConnectedOAuthAccounts`, `ListRepositories`, and `PersistOAuthToken` API actions are not intended to be called by your code\. Therefore, these API actions are not included in the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs\.

## AWS Managed \(Predefined\) Policies for CodeBuild<a name="managed-policies"></a>

AWS addresses many common use cases by providing standalone IAM policies that are created and administered by AWS\. These AWS managed policies grant necessary permissions for common use cases so you can avoid having to investigate what permissions are needed\. For more information, see [AWS Managed Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

The following AWS managed policies, which you can attach to users in your account, are specific to AWS CodeBuild\.
+ **AWSCodeBuildAdminAccess** – Provides full access to CodeBuild including permissions to administrate CodeBuild build projects\. 
+ **AWSCodeBuildDeveloperAccess** – Provides access to CodeBuild but does not allow build project administration\.
+ **AWSCodeBuildReadOnlyAccess** – Provides read\-only access to CodeBuild\.

To access build output artifacts that CodeBuild creates, you must also attach the AWS managed policy named **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess**\.

To create and manage CodeBuild service roles, you must also attach the AWS managed policy named **IAMFullAccess**\.

You can also create your own custom IAM policies to allow permissions for CodeBuild actions and resources\. You can attach these custom policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions\.

## CodeBuild Managed Policies and Notifications<a name="notifications-permissions"></a>

CodeBuild supports notifications, which can notify users of important changes to build projects\.  Managed policies for CodeBuild include policy statements for notification functionality\. For more information, see [What are notifications?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar-notifications/latest/userguide/welcome.html)\.

### Permissions Related to Notifications in Full Access Managed Policies<a name="notifications-fullaccess"></a>

The `AWSCodeBuildFullAccess` managed policy includes the following statements to allow full access to notifications\. Users with this managed policy applied can also create and manage Amazon SNS topics for notifications, subscribe and unsubscribe users to topics, and list topics to choose as targets for notification rules\.

```
    {
        "Sid": "CodeStarNotificationsReadWriteAccess",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "codestar-notifications:CreateNotificationRule",
            "codestar-notifications:DescribeNotificationRule",
            "codestar-notifications:UpdateNotificationRule",

### Permissions Related to Notifications in Read\-Only Managed Policies<a name="notifications-readonly"></a>

The `AWSCodeBuildReadOnlyAccess` managed policy includes the following statements to allow read\-only access to notifications\. Users with this managed policy applied can view notifications for resources, but cannot create, manage, or subscribe to them\. 

```
   {
        "Sid": "CodeStarNotificationsPowerUserAccess",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "codestar-notifications:DescribeNotificationRule"
        ],
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition" : {
            "StringLike" : {"codestar-notifications:NotificationsForResource" : "arn:aws:codebuild:*"} 
        }
    },    
    {
        "Sid": "CodeStarNotificationsListAccess",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "codestar-notifications:ListNotificationRules"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
    }
```

### Permissions Related to Notifications in Other Managed Policies<a name="notifications-otheraccess"></a>

The `AWSCodeBuildDeveloperAccess` managed policy includes the following statements to allow users to create, edit, and subscribe to notifications\. Users cannot delete notification rules or manage tags for resources\.

```
    {
        "Sid": "CodeStarNotificationsReadWriteAccess",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "codestar-notifications:CreateNotificationRule",
            "codestar-notifications:DescribeNotificationRule",
            "codestar-notifications:UpdateNotificationRule",
            "codestar-notifications:Subscribe",
            "codestar-notifications:Unsubscribe"
        ],
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition" : {
            "StringLike" : {"codestar-notifications:NotificationsForResource" : "arn:aws:codebuild*"} 
        }
    },    
    {
        "Sid": "CodeStarNotificationsListAccess",

## Customer\-Managed Policy Examples<a name="customer-managed-policies"></a>

In this section, you can find example user policies that grant permissions for AWS CodeBuild actions\. These policies work when you are using the CodeBuild API, AWS SDKs, or AWS CLI\. When you are using the console, you must grant additional permissions specific to the console\. For information, see [Permissions Required to Use the CodeBuild Console](#console-permissions)\.

You can use the following sample IAM policies to limit CodeBuild access for your IAM users and roles\.
