# Getting Started with CodeBuild<a name="getting-started-overview"></a>

In the following tutorials, you use AWS CodeBuild to build a collection of sample source code input files into a deployable version of the source code\.

Both tutorials have the same input and results, but one uses the CodeBuild console and the other uses the AWS CLI\. You can choose to follow either or both\.

**Important**  
It is not recommended that you use your AWS root account to complete this tutorial\.
