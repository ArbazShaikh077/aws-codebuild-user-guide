| [Support for a finally block in the buildspec file](#history) |  The CodeBuild documentation was updated with details about the optional `finally` block in a buildspec file\. Commands in the finally block always execute after the commands in its corresponding commands block\. For more information, see [Buildspec Syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-syntax)\.  | June 20, 2018 | 
| [CodeBuild agent update notifications](#history) |  The CodeBuild documentation was updated with details about how you can use Amazon SNS to be notified when new versions of the CodeBuild agent are released\. For more information, see [Receive Notifications for New AWS CodeBuild Agent Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/use-codebuild-agent.html#receive-codebuild-agent-notifications)\.  | June 15, 2018 |
