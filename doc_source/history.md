| Build badges support |  AWS CodeBuild now supports the use of build badges, which provide an embeddable, dynamically generated image \(badge\) that displays the status of the latest build for a project\. For more information, see [Build Badges Sample](sample-build-badges.md)\. | November 27, 2017 | 
| AWS Config integration |  AWS Config now supports AWS CodeBuild as an AWS resource, which means the service can track your AWS CodeBuild projects\. For more information about AWS Config, see [Use AWS Config with AWS CodeBuild Sample](how-to-integrate-config.md)\. | October 20, 2017 | 
| Automatically rebuild updated source code in GitHub repositories |  If your source code is stored in a GitHub repository, you can enable AWS CodeBuild to rebuild your source code whenever a code change is pushed to the repository\. For more information, see [GitHub Pull Request Sample](sample-github-pull-request.md)\. | September 21, 2017 | 
| New ways for storing and retrieving sensitive or large environment variables in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store | You can now use the AWS CodeBuild console or the AWS CLI to retrieve sensitive or large environment variables stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store\. You can also now use the AWS CodeBuild console to store these types of environment variables in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store\. Previously, you could only retrieve these types of environment variables by including them in a build spec or by running build commands to automate the AWS CLI\. You could only store these types of environment variables by using the Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store console\. For more information, see [Create a Build Project](create-project.md), [Change a Build Project's Settings](change-project.md), and [Run a Build](run-build.md)\. | September 14, 2017 |

| Updated way to retrieve sensitive or large environment variables stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store by using a build spec | AWS CodeBuild now makes it easier to use a build spec to retrieve sensitive or large environment variables stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store\. Previously, you could only retrieve these types of environment variables by running build commands to automate the AWS CLI\. For more information, see the parameter\-store mapping in [Build Spec Syntax](build-spec-ref.md#build-spec-ref-syntax)\. | August 10, 2017 | 
| AWS CodeBuild supports Bitbucket | AWS CodeBuild can now build from source code stored in a Bitbucket repository\. For more information, see [Create a Build Project](create-project.md) and [Run a Build](run-build.md)\. | August 10, 2017 |

| \.NET Core in Linux sample  | A sample showing how to use AWS CodeBuild and \.NET Core to build an executable file out of code written in C\# has been added\. For more information, see the [\.NET Core in Linux Sample](sample-net-core-linux.md)\. | June 29, 2017 | 
| Alternate build spec file names and locations supported | You can now specify an alternate file name or location of a build spec file to use for a build project, instead of a default build spec file named buildspec\.yml at the root of the source code\. For more information, see [Build Spec File Name and Storage Location](build-spec-ref.md#build-spec-ref-name-storage)\. | June 27, 2017 | 
| Updated build notifications sample | AWS CodeBuild now provides built\-in support for build notifications through Amazon CloudWatch Events and Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\)\.

| Docker in custom image sample added | A sample showing how to use AWS CodeBuild and a custom Docker build image to build and run a Docker image has been added\. For more information, see the [Docker in Custom Image Sample](sample-docker-custom-image.md)\. | June 7, 2017 | 
| Fetch source code for GitHub pull requests |  When you run a build with AWS CodeBuild that relies on source code stored in a GitHub repository, you can now specify a GitHub pull request ID to build\. You can also specify a commit ID, a branch name, or a tag name instead\. For more information, see the **Source version** value in [Run a Build \(Console\)](run-build.md#run-build-console) or the `sourceVersion` value in [Run a Build \(AWS CLI\)](run-build.md#run-build-cli)\.  | June 6, 2017 | 
| Build specification version updated | A new version of the build spec format has been released\. Version 0\.2 addresses the issue of AWS CodeBuild running each build command in a separate instance of the default shell\. Also in version 0\.2, environment\_variables is renamed to env, and plaintext is renamed to variables\. For more information, see [Build Specification Reference for AWS CodeBuild](build-spec-ref.md)\. | May 9, 2017 | 
| Dockerfiles for build images available in GitHub | Definitions for many of the build images provided by AWS CodeBuild are available as Dockerfiles in GitHub\.

| Build specs support fetching build output from within selected top\-level directories | Build specs now enable you to specify individual top\-level directories whose contents you can instruct AWS CodeBuild to include in build output artifacts\. You do this by using the base\-directory mapping\. For more information, see [Build Spec Syntax](build-spec-ref.md#build-spec-ref-syntax)\. | February 8, 2017 | 
| Built\-in environment variables  | AWS CodeBuild provides additional built\-in environment variables for your builds to use\. These include environment variables describing the entity that started the build, the URL to the source code repository, the source code's version ID, and more\.

For more information, see [Shells and Commands in Build Environments](build-env-ref-cmd.md)\. | December 9, 2016 | 
| Environment variables information  | AWS CodeBuild provides several environment variables that you can use in your build commands\. You can also define your own environment variables\.
